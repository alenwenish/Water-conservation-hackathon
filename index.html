                We all know water is essential, but too many of us think it’s unlimited. <br><br>
                In reality, fresh water is a finite resource that is rapidly becoming scarce. <br><br>
                In India, a warming climate is drying up lakes and rivers, while rapid urbanisation and water pollution
                are putting enormous pressure on the quantity and quality of surface and ground water. <br><br>
                The country’s fragile agricultural system still depends primarily on rainfall and a bad monsoon season
                can wreck havoc on the national economy. <br><br>
                Water conservation is a key element of any strategy that aims to alleviate the water scarcity crisis in
                India. <br><br>
            </p>

            <h2> What does Water Conservation means ?</h2>

            <p>Water conservation refers to the preservation, control and development of water resources, both surface
                and groundwater, and prevention of pollution. <br><br>
                Water conservation is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage.
                <br><br>
                According to Fresh Water Watch, water conservation is important because fresh clean water is a limited
                resource, as well as a costly one. <br><br>
